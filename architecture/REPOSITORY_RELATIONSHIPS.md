## Composition, service, and observability contract

Git submodules compose editable source; Zed packages resolve packages/artifacts; dual-managed commits must match. Production deploys immutable image digests, not runtime source builds. Cross-service access uses APIs/SDKs/events rather than another service database. MCP uses the product API/SDK. Services emit OpenTelemetry traces, bounded metrics, and correlated structured logs.

## Privacy boundary

This public registry deliberately omits private repository names and edges; the count above makes the boundary explicit.
